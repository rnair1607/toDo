# toDo

This frontend application is a Todo web app developed using VueJS 2 with VueX for state management and Tailwind for styling the layouts and components. The dev server can be hosted locally. This lets you test the application on a real mobile device on the same network [here](http://192.168.1.238:8000/ "http://192.168.1.238:8000/"). Jest framework is used to implement scripts for the Vue application. It is not complete, currently, the test scripts only perform component testing for some of the implemented components. Below are the commands to run and test the application.
